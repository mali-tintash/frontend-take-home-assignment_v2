# Origin Frontend Take-Home Assignment

**IMPORTANT**: you can choose any technology stack to implement this assignment. We will consider exclusively the quality of your project (technology and product-wise) to evaluate your work.

Origin is a platform that helps our customers' employees put their financial lives on track.

One key to financial well-being is planning & saving for your goals. Users can have many saving goals (e.g. go to college or throw a wedding party) and it is our job to help them accomplish it.

You will build a piece of our savings feature by creating the savings plan simulation screen.

### The Saving Goal Plan Simulation Screen

You will build a screen where the user will simulate saving towards the "Buy a house" savings goal.
In it, the users choose (i) the value they want to save and (ii) the date they plan to reach the goal.

When the users change the value of any of the inputs, the monthly deposit value is calculated and displayed to them.

### Evaluation
Be aware that Origin will mainly take into consideration the following evaluation criteria:
* How close your page is to the mockups, both on mobile & desktop;
* How clean and organized your code is;
* How good your automated tests are, i.e.: qualitative over quantitative (in case of usage of this base project, feel free to choose between jest or testing library);
* If you implemented the business rules correctly.

### Assets
You can find the layout mockups here on our Figma project:
